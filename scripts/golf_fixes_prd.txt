# ThreeWood Golf Game Fixes PRD

## Overview
This PRD outlines the necessary fixes and improvements for the ThreeWood golf game. We need to address several issues to improve the gameplay experience and visual quality.

## Required Fixes

### 1. Stylized Grass Texture Fix
The putting green is using the wrong texture. We need to update it to use the correct stylized grass texture.

- **Current Issue**: The texture path is incorrect or the texture is not loading properly
- **Required Fix**: Update the texture path to use `C:\Users\Memory is RAM\Documents\projects\threeWood\src\Textures\Stylized_Grass_003_SD-20250506T130641Z-1-001\Stylized_Grass_003_SD\Material_1786.jpg`
- **Expected Outcome**: The putting green should display the correct stylized grass texture

### 2. Direction Arrow Enhancement
The direction arrow that points to the hole needs to be improved to dynamically update as the camera moves.

- **Current Issue**: The arrow doesn't update its direction when the camera position changes
- **Required Fix**: Update the direction arrow logic to recalculate its orientation based on camera position
- **Expected Outcome**: The arrow should always accurately point toward the hole regardless of camera movement

### 3. Golf Flag 3D Model Implementation
The golf flag needs to be replaced with a proper 3D model.

- **Current Issue**: Currently using a simple geometric representation instead of the 3D model
- **Required Fix**: Implement the 3D model from `src\Assets\golf hole flag.glb`
- **Expected Outcome**: A visually appealing 3D flag model should appear at the hole

### 4. Ball Reset and Hit Functionality
After the ball resets, the player should be able to hit it again.

- **Current Issue**: After the ball resets, the player cannot hit it again
- **Required Fix**: Ensure the game state properly transitions to allow hitting after a reset
- **Expected Outcome**: Player should be able to hit the ball after it has been reset

## Implementation Priority
The issues should be addressed in the following order:

1. Ball Reset and Hit Functionality (most critical for gameplay)
2. Stylized Grass Texture Fix (visual improvement)
3. Golf Flag 3D Model Implementation (visual enhancement)
4. Direction Arrow Enhancement (usability improvement)

## Technical Considerations
- All fixes should maintain compatibility with the existing codebase
- Performance should not be significantly impacted
- Code should follow the existing patterns and conventions
