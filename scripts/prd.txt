- Spin effects (backspin/topspin)
- Terrain interaction with slope handling
- Side-spin for hook/slice shots
- Wind effects on ball flight

### Camera System
- Dynamic camera following
- Predictive following for fast ball movement
- Terrain clipping prevention
- Dynamic field of view adjustments
- Camera shake effects

### Course Design
- 9-hole golf course with varying difficulty
- Tee boxes, fairways, and greens
- Hazards and bunkers
- Elevation changes
- Unique course features

### Club System
- Driver for distance
- Mid-range irons
- Wedges for high loft shots
- Putters for green shots
- Automatic club selection

### Input System
- Power meter control
- Shot shaping (fade/draw)
- Advanced aiming
- Putting green grid overlay
- Controller support
